# Automatic Delivery Progression System - Usage Guide

## 🚁 **Complete Automatic Delivery Lifecycle**

The MediFly system now features **automatic delivery progression** that simulates the complete drone delivery process from doctor approval to delivery completion.

### **How It Works**

When a doctor approves a patient delivery request, the system automatically:

1. **Doctor Approval** → Delivery status changes to "approved"
2. **Wait 1 minute** → Medication preparation phase
3. **Status: In-Transit** → Drone dispatched with live tracking
4. **Wait 5 minutes** → Delivery in progress (customizable estimated time)
5. **Status: Delivered** → Order completed with delivery timestamp

### **Testing the System**

#### **Option 1: Demo Tracking Page (Quickest)**
1. Go to: `/demo/tracking`
2. Click **"Start Auto Progression (6 min demo)"**
3. Watch the real-time progression:
   - Status indicators update automatically
   - Countdown timer shows remaining time
   - Tracking interface changes based on current status
4. See all three states: Pending → In-Transit → Delivered

#### **Option 2: Full Workflow (Complete Experience)**
1. **Patient Side:**
   - Go to `/demo/patient`
   - Create a new delivery request (any medication)
   - Note the delivery ID

2. **Doctor Side:**
   - Go to `/demo/doctor`
   - Find the pending delivery in the approval queue
   - Click "Approve" on the delivery

3. **Watch Automatic Progression:**
   - Status immediately changes to "approved"
   - After 1 minute: Status becomes "in-transit"
   - After 6 minutes total: Status becomes "delivered"

4. **Track Progress:**
   - Use the "Track" button from either dashboard
   - Or visit `/tracking?id={deliveryId}&type=patient`

### **Technical Features**

#### **Real-Time Updates**
- ✅ 5-second position updates during transit
- ✅ Live drone telemetry (battery, speed, temperature)
- ✅ Environmental monitoring (wind conditions)
- ✅ Progress timeline with visual indicators

#### **Persistent State**
- ✅ Progressions survive page reloads
- ✅ Automatic resumption after browser restart
- ✅ Proper cleanup on completion

#### **Smart Progression Logic**
- ✅ Handles overdue deliveries
- ✅ Calculates remaining time accurately
- ✅ Updates both patient and doctor storage
- ✅ Triggers storage events for real-time UI updates

### **Demo Controls**

The `/demo/tracking` page includes:
- **Start Auto Progression**: Begins 6-minute demo cycle
- **Reset Demo**: Clears current progression
- **Clear All**: Removes all progression data
- **Manual Status**: Switch between states manually (disabled during auto mode)
- **Live Timer**: Shows exact time remaining

### **Customization**

Default timing (easily adjustable):
- **Preparation Time**: 1 minute
- **Transit Time**: 5 minutes for demo, uses actual `estimatedTime` in real requests
- **Update Frequency**: Every 5 seconds for live tracking

### **Integration Points**
